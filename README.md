# Proj_03C_Logistic_Diabetes_Pima_Indians

This project is based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, where, using medical details, it predicts whether a person is likely to develop diabetes within the next 5 years. This is a binary classification problem, and the Logistic Regression algorithm is used.

Purpose
To predict diabetes based on medical data.

To understand and implement the basic steps of machine learning (data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation).

To evaluate the performance of the Logistic Regression model using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Scaling the data using StandardScaler.

Model Training: Using LogisticRegression.

Performance Evaluation: Using confusion_matrix and accuracy_score.

Visualization: Graphical display of the confusion matrix using ConfusionMatrixDisplay.

Usage Instructions
Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Download the dataset:
Place the pima_indians_diabetes.csv file in your project folder.


View the output:

The confusion matrix and accuracy score will be printed in the console.

A graphical display of the confusion matrix will also appear.
